Notes on Kinesis and Cloudformation:

Kinesis Stream - independent piece of infrastructure - "backbone"
Example - we might add other streaming sources to put records into this stream

Kinesis Firehose - independent piece of infrastructure - "backbone"

In this situation, it is configured to:
1. Uses a Kinesis Stream as Source
2. Uses S3 as Destination

These backbone pieces are completely seperate from the Lambda functions - do not need shared roles, policies, or deployments.


Notes on CF - Configuring #1 - Kinesis Stream as a Source:

1. KinesisStreamSourceConfiguration
When a Kinesis stream is used as the source for the delivery stream, a Kinesis Data Firehose DeliveryStream KinesisStreamSourceConfiguration containing the Kinesis stream ARN and the role ARN for the source stream.

Required: No

Type: Kinesis Data Firehose DeliveryStream KinesisStreamSourceConfiguration

Update requires: No interruption

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-kinesisfirehose-deliverystream-kinesisstreamsourceconfiguration.html

2. S3DestinationConfiguration
An Amazon S3 destination for the delivery stream.

Required: Conditional. You must specify only one destination configuration.

Type: Kinesis Firehose DeliveryStream S3DestinationConfiguration

Update requires: No interruption. If you change the delivery stream destination from an Amazon S3 destination to an Amazon ES destination, update requires some interruptions.

Firehose CF Setting:
Compression
GZIP compression keeps it compatible in case we ever want to send to redshfift

IAM role
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/controlling-access.html#using-iam-s3

You can choose to create a new role where required permissions are assigned automatically, or choose an existing role created for Kinesis Data Firehose. 
*The role is used to grant Kinesis Data Firehose access to your S3 bucket, AWS KMS key (if data encryption is enabled), and Lambda function (if data transformation is enabled).* 
The console might create a role with placeholders. You can safely ignore or safely delete lines with %FIREHOSE_BUCKET_NAME%, %FIREHOSE_DEFAULT_FUNCTION%, or %FIREHOSE_DEFAULT_VERSION%. 
For more information, see Grant Kinesis Data Firehose Access to an Amazon S3 Destination.
